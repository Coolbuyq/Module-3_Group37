## Remote Keyless Entry
* Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob. 
* A remote keyless entry car kit doesn’t rely on a physical button or panel in order to get into your vehicle, but instead it has a sensor that detects your remote keyless key fob within a certain range of your vehicle. It then unlocks once you touch the door handle, but only while the key is nearby. Remote keyless entry cars also often allow for remote starting, as long as the remote key fob is within a short distance of the vehicle. Remote keyless communications are done through encrypted radio signals, and this can either be done through short range radio to a remote key fob in your pocket, or it can be hooked up to a smartphone system and can actually be controlled over cellular networks from anywhere in the world.

  ## SWOT Analysis
  ### Strength
  * Press button 4 times, All led glows in anticlockwise manner
  * Advance security
  ### Weakness
  * Replacing a lost fob costs much more than a traditional key electronic components wear out over time, which then means replacement of either the key or system repair
  ### Opportunities
  * Allow users to use their smartphones as keys, even controlling extra features like remote start from these handheld devices
  ### Threats
  * Thieves, however, are rising to the challenge, using radio transmitters to perform ‘relay’ car hacks to capture the signal from the car’s fob 
  * Possibility for hackers to manipulate the technology and steal your vehicle

## 4W's And !H
### Who
* owner of the vehicle
### What
* Keyless entry systems are used to remotely lock, unlock and can have various features
### When
* Within a range of distance a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver unit in the car, which locks or unlocks the door And do the task require.
### Why
* remote keyless entry systems alarm the vehicle against theft and lock and unlock the doors
### How
* Keyless entry to a vehicle is usually attained by sending a radio frequency signal from a remote transmitter to the receiver in the car
